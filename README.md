# Black Zine Fair Website
This is the website for the [Black Zine Fair](http://blackzinefair.org). The Black Zine Fair is a celebration of all things Black and independent publishing in New York City! We invite Black exhibitors and educators to gather, trade or sell zines, and exchange knowledge surrounding zine-making, publishing, and do-it-yourself culture.
